# Fundamentals-of-Object-Oriented-Programming
1.	In the field of programming, Iteration Statements are helpful when we need a specific task in repetition. Theyâ€™re essential as they reduce hours of work to seconds. An iteration is a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached. As per given statement you need to implement the task using iterations. 
A number is said to be valid if it is divisible by 8. Develop a logic that allows the user to keep entering numbers as long as the input is valid and also displays a count of the valid numbers. 
Sample Input and Output:
Enter the number
8
Enter the number
16
Enter the number
96
Enter the number
6
Total 3 numbers are valid numbers.

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

bool isValid(int number) {
    return number % 8 == 0;
}

int main() {
    int number;
    int count = 0;

    while (true) {
        cout << "Enter the number: ";
        cin >> number;

        if (isValid(number)) {
            count++;
        } else {
            break;
        }
    }

    cout << "Total " << count << " numbers are valid numbers." << endl;

    return 0;
}
